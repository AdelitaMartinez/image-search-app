### JavaScript Features

#### `.map` Function

The `.map` function is used in JavaScript to iterate over an array and perform a specified operation on each element. In this project, we use the `.map` function to iterate over the array of image search results returned by the Unsplash API. Each image result is transformed into a structured HTML element that is then displayed on the page.


## API Usage

This project utilizes the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to fetch high-quality images based on user queries. The API provides a vast collection of freely-usable images, allowing users to discover and explore diverse visual content.
